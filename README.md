# OpenGL-Space-Invaders

I made this very simple space invaders clone in order to learn how to program abstractions given by a game engine from scratch, as well as learn
about the rendering process in OpenGL. I also used this project to learn how object oriented programming works in C++. 

# Features
1) Sprite renderer
2) Animation system
3) Collision detection
4) Silly pictures of my friends

# References
When writing this code I referenced [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout) and [The Cherno's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw) youtube tutorials.
